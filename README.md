# Morpho Dimension

This is a React Single Page Application that integrates with `macrojuegos.com` API and delivers some extra community features.

## Upcoming Features

You can have a look at the [Morpho D. Web Page project](https://github.com/zebnat/morpho-dimension/projects/1) and see what we will implement in the future.

## History

Daniel (Zebnat), creator of [danieldev.es](https://danieldev.es/en/) is also the main maintainer and developer of Morpho Dimension. He was employed by Panaworld for 8 years as a FullStack Developer, Product Owner and SEO, working mainly on [macrojuegos.com](https://www.macrojuegos.com/) and taking care of community members.

Because `macrojuegos.com` doesn't have enough udpates, Morpho Dimension is a gap between his old work and a new era. Trying to deliver some extra features that makes the community happy while also learning and experimenting with web technologies.

Morpho D. is also loosely coupled, which means that if something wents wrong between Panaworld and danieldev.es it will be easy to detach the service from `macrojuegos.com`.

Morpho D. may have his own database in the future, connecting other [danieldev.es](https://danieldev.es/en/) services or communities like his [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.com/zebnat) through Twitch API or something else like cloud serverless services.
